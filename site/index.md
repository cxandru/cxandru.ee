title: "Cass Alexandru (they/them)"
---

I'm a PhD student at the [Working Group Programming Languages](https://pl.informatik.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/) at the RPTU, supervised by [Ralf Hinze](https://pl.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/staff/RalfHinze/). My current research topic is application of category theory to the design of intrinsically correct algorithms, in particular bialgebraic semantics.

More broadly, I'm interested in the application of the full breadth of the theoretical arsenal to the problem of ergonomic use of dependently typed programming languages in practice, including but not limited to: <br/>
datatype-generic programming, recursion schemes, homotopy type theory, EDSLs, compiler construction, decision procedures, SMT, ATPs, proof/program synthesis

## Online presence

I go by `cxandru` on most online forums, and also use the same profile icon everywhere, so I should be relatively easy to spot. My accounts on selected forums:

* Mastodon: [@cxandru@types.pl](https://types.pl/@cxandru)
* Github: [cxandru](https://github.com/cxandru/)
